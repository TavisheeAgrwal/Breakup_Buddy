# Cognitive Reframing Exercises

**Challenging "All or Nothing" Thinking:** Breakups often trigger extreme thoughts like "I will never be happy again" or "I am a failure." Challenge this by asking, "What small evidence proves this thought is too extreme?" Replace "I am a failure" with "I am someone who tried, and now I'm learning."

**Focus on Personal Growth:** Reframe the relationship's end not as a loss, but as an opportunity. List 3 things you learned about yourself or your needs during the relationship. List 3 ways you want to grow in the next year.

**The "What If?" Trap:** When you think "What if I had done X?", counter it with, "That decision is in the past. What decision can I make *right now* to help my future self?"
