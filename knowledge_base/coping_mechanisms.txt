# Immediate Coping Techniques for Acute Distress

**The 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding Technique:** Use this when overwhelmed. Name 5 things you can SEE, 4 things you can TOUCH, 3 things you can HEAR, 2 things you can SMELL, and 1 thing you can TASTE. This redirects the mind to the present moment.

**Square Breathing:** Inhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4, exhale for a count of 4, hold for a count of 4. Repeat 4 times. This calms the nervous system.

**Journaling the "Brain Dump":** Write down every single thought, no matter how chaotic, for 10 minutes without stopping. Do not re-read it. The goal is to get the thoughts out of your head and onto the paper.
